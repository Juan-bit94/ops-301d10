# VPN Tunnel
## Why this topic matter
- This topic matters because as the world moves to a more work from home hybrid model, it is important to know and understand how VPNs work. 
1. What is a site-to-site VPN?
- A site-to-site (VPN) is a connection set up between multiple networks.
- Its useful for companies that prioritize provate, protected traffic, and with more than one office spread out over large geographical locations.
2. What is TCP/IP and what is it used for?
- TCP/IP outlines how data is organized according to packets, given addresses, transmitted, and received across different computers on the internet.
- Computers were connected between sites through a private network and TCP/IP before the internet was introduced to the world.
3. What are some popular reasons for using a VPN?
- VPNs gained popularity because people want to mask their IP addresses and explore the internet in a secure way.
- People can use VPNs to gain access to geo-blocked contnent from a streaming service, can download torrents, and have a more secure connection to the internet with encryption.
4. Explain the difference between the three types of VPNs.
- There are serveral types of VPNs, the selection depends on the needs of the individual or organization.
  - Remote Access VPN
    - A remote access VPN is a temporary connection set up between two or more users and a central location.
    - A remote access VPN is a useful tool for companies with remote  workers either on the road or in their homes.
    - People who need to access private or sensitive information housed in a company's servers, they can connect to a remote access VPN.
  - Intranet-based Site-to-Site
    - An intranet-based site-to-site VPN connects more than one local-area network (LAN) to form a wide-area network (WAN).
    - A company may also use this kind of setup to incorporate software-defined WAN (SD-WAN).
    - Intranet-based site-to-site VPNs are useful tools for combining resources housed in disparate offices securly as if they were all in the same location.
  - Extranet-based Site-to-Site
    - This VPN is often used by two or more different companies that want to share certain resources but keep others private.
    - With this type of VPN, each entity connects to the VPN and chooses what tehy want to make available to other companies. That way collaboration and sharing can happen without exposing proprietary data.  
## Things I want to know more about
- I would like to know what are the security concerns for establishing a VPN, such as weakpoints or worst-case senario.
