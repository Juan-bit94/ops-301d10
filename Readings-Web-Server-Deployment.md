# Web Server Deployment
## Why does this topic matter
- This topic matters because as IT and cybersecurity experts we should be mindful of the available open source server technologies available.
- NGINX is a very popular high performance server, and knowing about it will enable us as IT professional to set it up and resolve issues for NGINX servers. 
## What are some common use cases for NGINX?
- While the goal of the NGINX was to make a fast webserver, it can be also used with caching, reverse proxying, and load balancing to name a few.
## How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?
- NGINX uses event driven asynchronous architecture. Normally, traditional servers would create a new thread or process for each incoming connection. NGINX's model allows it to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a small and predictable amounts of resources. 
## Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce "NGINX", and why an org might choose to use it?
- I would let people know its pronounced as "nextgen", and an org might use NGINX servers if they have a need for high performance, resource efficiency and scalability.
## Things I want to know more about.
- I'd like to know how the setup is done, how its monitored, and audited.
