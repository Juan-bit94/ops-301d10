# Network Segmentation
## Why this topic matter
-
1. What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
- A CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block, which is a range of IP addresses.
2. How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
- An IPv4 address is represented as four 8-bit decimal. 
3. Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
- An 8-but number when represented in the decimal system as opposed to binary has a range of 0 - 255. 
4. What does the final digit after the "/" represent in an IPv4 address?
- In CIDR notation, the final digit after the "/" represents how many bits make up the mask in an IPv4 address? 
5. How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
- There are 256 IP addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR block. The math works like this: 32-24 = 8. 2^8 = 256. That is how we find the amount of IP addresses we have available. 
## What is Network Segmentation and Why it Matters?
1. In your own words, describe network segmentation.
- 
2. Network segmentation isn't important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?

3. What is a screened subnet?
