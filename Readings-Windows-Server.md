# Windows Server
## Why this topic matters
- It's important to understand as an IT professional that servers run many processes and require different hardware specifications.
- Many people hear the word "server" and might have a vague idea of what they do, but the reality is that they are two different things (servers vs desktops).
## What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers?
- A server is designed to run services people access across the a network, services such as file, print, and email services to name a few.
- I would tell my friend that a server is a workhorse. While desktops allow users to conduct regular operations such as reading and writing to a text file, a servicer is running programs that provide services to many devices connected to it.
- Also, I'd tell my friend that servers usually do not come with a graphical user interface, in fact, the less overhead the better for servers. All in all, desktops serve that one individual with simple tasks, but servers serve a lot more people with complicated stuff.
## How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?
- Windows 10 updates arrive faster and more often. Windows servers on the other hand require a few steps since servers have more security built into it.
## Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?
- Windows Servers have more options when it comes to hardware requirements. Windows servers allow for up to 24 terabytes of RAM and it has no limit for CPU cores.
- Windows home or pro will be limited. The max for ram is 2 terabytes and 1 to 2 CPUs. 
## Things I want to know more about
- I would like to know more about the hardware specs for different servers, especially the open source ones such as Apache and NXIGN.
- I would also like to know if Windows server is offered as a service, license, or standalone?
