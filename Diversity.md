# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry
## Why this topic matters
- Diversity is not only a noble goal, but it also makes sense economically.
- People like to see themselves be represented and know that they are in consideration when something is being developed or produced.
- If you leave people out of the business, you risk losing out on the benefits in problem solving and base user growth.
## What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
- Personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
- There was a narrative that computers are for boys, films and culture contributed to this.
## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- It matters because throughout the years, those males will become more adept with computer science and engineering principles.
- For an individual who did not grow up with computers, it may lead to a disadvantage in the future if they seek to get into that field.
## When are diversity efforts most successful?
- When they are driven by a commitment from company leaders.
## Why do diverse companies perform better?
- It offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.
- The more diverse a group of people are, the more ways they can see a problem differently leading to faster and better ways of solving it.
## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
- Youtube developed a iOSapp without considering how right-handed people would use it. This caused 5% to 10% of videos being uploaded upside down.
## What I would like to know more about.
- I am interested to know how the topic of diversity in the technology field is being discussed in other nations.
- The United States is not the only country with a diverse population. I would like to know if the UK, Europe, and other countries are championing diversity or if they are not doing anything and what the results are.
